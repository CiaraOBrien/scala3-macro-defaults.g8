A somewhat "opinionated", as they say, Scala 3 [Giter8][g8] template, primarily for my own use. It comes with all the Scala 3 optional syntax features/type system restrictions, plus erased terms enabled, plus the option of a "playground" (in `tasty/`) that can be used to easily view the output of post-phase printers without exposing the whole project to their scrutiny (and therefore spamming the console horribly every time you compile). Additionally, there's the option of starting with Cats and/or Minitest, since I usually default to those two despite rarely making much use of them.
